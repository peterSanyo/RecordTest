// MARK: - Model

// This is the model for your widget's content. It conforms to TimelineEntry, which means it represents a single entry in the widget's timeline.
// It includes a date, indicating when this entry is relevant, and a list of recordings, which are the URLs to the audio recordings you want to display.
// WidgetKit uses this struct to understand what data to display at what time.
struct RecordingEntry: TimelineEntry {
    let date: Date
    let recordings: [URL]
}

// MARK: - Factory

// This is the 'factory' that creates the timeline entries for your widget. As a TimelineProvider, it's responsible for telling WidgetKit what to display and when.
// The placeholder method provides a preview of the widget in the Widget gallery before the widget is added to the watch face.
// The getSnapshot method provides a quick look at the widget's current state, used for previews while editing the watch face.
// The getTimeline method provides a sequence of entries that WidgetKit will transition through over time. This is where you'd fetch the latest recording data and schedule updates.

// MARK: - WidgetEntryView

// This is the SwiftUI view that defines the UI of your widget. It uses the data from RecordingEntry to build the interface that users will see.
// It uses the @Environment property wrapper to adapt its layout based on the complication family being used (such as .accessoryCircular, .accessoryCorner, etc.).
// Inside this view, you would typically switch on the widgetFamily to provide different layouts for different complication sizes and shapes.

struct RecorderWidgetEntryView: View {

// MARK: - Main Entry Point

// This is the main entry point of your widget extension. It defines the overall configuration of your widget.
// It uses StaticConfiguration to set up a non-configurable widget that doesn't rely on user-selected options.
// It sets the kind, which is a unique identifier for the widget, used by the system to differentiate it from other widgets.
// The configurationDisplayName and description provide the name and description that appear in the widget gallery.
// The supportedFamilies array tells WidgetKit which complication families your widget supports.
